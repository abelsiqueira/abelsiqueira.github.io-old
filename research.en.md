I work with computational mathematics, mostly with nonlinear optimization.
Some topics of my interest:

  - Unconstrained minimization methods;
  - Boxed constrained minimization;
  - Julia language;
  - Comparison and benchmarking of optimization methods.
  - Reproducible science;
  - Free open source tools;

I have interest in, or am working at, the following projects.
If you are a student looking for a research topic, this is a good start.

### CUTEst.jl

[CUTEsj.jl](https://github.com/optimizers/CUTEst.jl) is a Julia interface for
the CUTEst repository.
This interface provides many ways to access the CUTEst functions, allowing a
work-now-improve-later workflow for nonlinear optimization.

### Reproducible Science and Free Open Source Software

When the next "best optimization algorithm ever" comes around, I want to be able
to verify the claim.
This is only possible through reproducible science.
The data and steps that describe a research should be available to the peers.
Some easy steps can be taken to improve the reproducibility and availability of
a research project, and I think believe this should be of greater concern that
it is.

Furthermore, when dealing with reproducible science, I believe that free
software should be considered whenever possible.
The reproducibility of a project is limited when using proprietary software.

### Computational Tools for Researchers and Software Carpentry

In the spirit of good and reproducible science, some tools are very important,
and useful, for a researchers.
Despite the field, a researcher may find that some tasks would be better left
for the computer, such as renaming thousands of files.

One organization that helps in that endeavor is
[Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/).
Software Carpentry provides researchers with a short introduction class to
several of these tools. Whenever possible, instructors are taken from the same
field as that of the researcher.
