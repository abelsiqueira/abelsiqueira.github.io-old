JuliaSmoothOptimizers is a framework for the development of nonlinear optimization methods in the Julia Language. It consists of over 20 packages dealing with numerical linear algebra and optimization. More specifically, includes:

- Matrix-free linear operators;
- Tools for linear systems and least-squares problems;
- Problem definition;
- Access to problems from CUTEst, AMPL, and JuMP;
- Tools for easy benchmarking;
- Performance profiles;
- Generation of tables in LaTeX and Markdown;
- Pure Julia solvers;
- Wrappers for IPOPT and KNITRO.

Dynamic Control of Infeasibility in C++. This software was developed during my doctorate, so the implementation is fairly old. Check JuliaSmoothOptimizers for newer packages dealing with nonlinear optimization.
